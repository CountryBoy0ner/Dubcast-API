# Problem Statement & Goals

## Context

Music streaming today is mostly **on‑demand**: users pick an album, playlist, or an algorithmic recommendation and listen alone.
In contrast, classic radio creates a **live moment** — many people listen to the same track at the same time, which naturally forms a lightweight community around the stream.

**Dubcast** is an educational Internet radio project that combines:
- **Human‑curated playlists** (not algorithmic подборки),
- A **scheduled** playback model (“what’s playing now” is based on server time),
- A simple **social layer**: chat + user profile.

The system operates in the domain of **online radio / community music platforms** and integrates with **SoundCloud** as an external content source for importing tracks and playlists.

## Problem Statement

**Who:** listeners who want a shared “live radio” experience, and an administrator who curates content.

**What:** existing platforms focus on algorithmic/on‑demand listening and often lack a simple, built‑in community layer (live chat + identity). Curated “radio-like” experiences are harder to maintain without scheduling tools and validation.

**Why:** human selection gives a different value than algorithmic подборки — each playlist is an intentional selection made by a person. The live moment + chat turns passive listening into a shared experience and helps discover creators (via profile links).

### Pain Points

| # | Pain Point | Severity | Current Workaround |
|---|------------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Listening is usually isolated (on‑demand, algorithmic). No “we are all listening together” moment. | High | Users join Discord/Telegram communities separately from the music platform. |
| 2 | Human‑curated “radio” content is difficult to manage without scheduling and overlap validation. | Medium | Manual spreadsheets / trial‑and‑error; conflicts appear only after deployment. |
| 3 | Many music platforms do not provide a simple, integrated way to communicate and present the listener’s identity/links. | Medium | Users share links in external social network; no single profile inside the app. |

## Business Goals

| Goal | Description | Success Indicator |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Provide a live, radio‑like experience | Users can open the app and immediately listen to the current scheduled track (“now playing”). | “Now playing” endpoint works reliably; playback starts. |
| Preserve human curation | The schedule and playlists are controlled by an admin (curator), not generated by an algorithm. | Admin can manage tracks/playlists/schedule via API; changes affect playback. |
| Add lightweight community features | Users can chat while listening and have a profile with optional links to their music. | Chat endpoints work; profile endpoints allow username/bio updates. |

## Objectives & Metrics

> This is a diploma project, so the “current value” is **N/A (new system)**. Targets are defined for demo readiness.

| Objective | Metric | Current Value | Target Value | Timeline |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Stable “Now Playing” | Success rate of `GET /api/radio/now` under normal use | Works in demo (manual verification) | ≥ 99% during demo session | Before final demo |
| Live community feeling | Chat works end‑to‑end (send + load history) |Works in demo (manual verification) | 100% functional in demo | Before final demo |
| Listener analytics | Online counter updates while listening | Works in demo (manual verification) | Updates in real time (heartbeat + TTL) | Before final demo |
| Reproducible builds | CI pipeline status | CI passing on PR  | Green on PR to main/develop | Throughout development |
| Reproducible deployment | Docker Compose run from GHCR image | Not tested on clean machine yet | `docker compose up` works from clean machine | Before final demo |

## Success Criteria

### Must Have

- [ ] Users can open the Radio page and start/stop playback.
- [ ] “Now playing” is calculated on the backend by server time and displayed in the UI.
- [ ] Online counter updates in real time (heartbeat + TTL expiration).
- [ ] Chat: load recent messages + send message as an authenticated user.
- [ ] Admin can manage tracks/playlists/schedule via REST API (Swagger), with validation against overlaps.
- [ ] CI/CD builds, runs tests, and publishes the backend image to GHCR.

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Better mobile UI adaptation and full mobile testing.
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent listeners and API performance benchmarks.
- [ ] Admin UI (instead of API‑only management).

## Non-Goals

What this project explicitly does NOT aim to achieve:

- Full-scale commercial streaming platform (recommendation engine, monetization, licensing).
- Advanced moderation tools for chat (anti‑spam, filters) beyond basic validation.
- Complex admin panel UI — admin operations are intentionally **API‑only** in the current scope.
