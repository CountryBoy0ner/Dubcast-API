# Dubcast-Web-Radio-Platform
Java Spring Boot monolith with Thymeleaf, with plans to separate the front-end application. The interface is minimal and adaptive, and user data (passwords and email addresses) is encrypted with AES-256 at the database level. Lightweight real-time statistics on current listeners are supported.
